# Reversi
Code for finding the next step on [reversi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) using Alpha Beta Pruning

This was a fun exercise to implement [Alpha-Beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) pruning algorithm
to determine the best next play for a given player.  

Each input should contain
1. player to move (X or O)
2. search cut-off depth
3. game position (including the board state and the player to move)  

Check input directory for examples.  

To run the code,  
```shell
python reversi.py
```
